# Users Can Bypass the Delayed Withdrawal

## Summary

    `modifier delayedWithdrawal()` is supposed to delay withdrawals for a fixed time starting from when the user deposits to when they can withdraw. However, the timer can be set before any withdrawals are made. When the timer expires, the user can withdraw immediately after depositing.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is how a user can bypass the delayed withdrawal:

Call `requestWithdraw()`. Note that you donâ€™t need any funds deposited to call the request withdraw() function. 
`withdrawalRequestTimestamps[msg.sender]` has not been set yet, which let us to bypass the `require` statements.

This will set` withdrawRequestTimestamps` of `msg.sender` to the current `block.timestamp`.

After the `withdrawalDelay` time passes, user can deposit and withdraw immediately.

This deposit does not reset withdrawRequestTimestamps, and the time is cacluated as if the user had deposited at the time 

## Impact

The Withdrawal Delay time is calculated as if the user had deposited at the time they initially called the first withdraw() The modifier is bypassed, slashing can be frontrun.
