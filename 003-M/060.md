# A malicious user could delay their stake from being slashed

## Summary

Users could delay slashing by front-running ```slash``` and staking a small amount so that ```checkpointProtection``` reverts.

## Vulnerability Detail

A user could call ```stake``` right before the slasher can call ```slash``` to delay their stake from getting slashed. The call to ```slash``` would fail because ```slash``` calls ```_claimAndExit``` which has ```checkpointProtection```. The ```checkpointProtection``` modifier would revert because ```stake``` was called in the same block as ```slash```.

If ```withdrawalDelay``` is non-zero, a user could delay a slash until the withdrawal delay is over and exit their stake before getting slashed. If ```withdrawalDelay``` is 0, the user could just exit before being slashed without needing to repeatedly delay the slash.

## Impact

A user could escape slashing penalties.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing functions that are specific to slash for the exiting and claiming of a slashed user's stake that do not need checkpoint protection.
