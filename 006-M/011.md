# `_claimFromIndividualPlugin` does not check whether the plugin has been disabled

## Summary

`_claimFromIndividualPlugin` does not check whether the plugin has been disabled.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deactivated` function in the `IPlugin` interface is used to determine whether the Plugin has been closed. If the Plugin has been closed, the reward should not be issued. But this judgment is not made in `_claimFromIndividualPlugin`.

## Impact

Disabled plugins can still claim rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`_claimFromIndividualPlugin` judges `Plugin.deactivated` first, and returns directly if the plugin has been closed.
