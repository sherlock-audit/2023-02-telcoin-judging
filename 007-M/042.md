# Use of safeApprove might cause transferERCToBridge to revert

## Summary

The `safeApprove` method is used inside the `transferERCToBridge`. However, this function is deprecated and might cause the function to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

`RootBridgeRelay` uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s safeApprove() within the transferERCToBridge which has been documented as 1) Deprecated because of approve-like race condition and 2) To be used only for initial setting of allowance (current allowance == 0) or resetting to 0 because it reverts otherwise. You can find a detailed explanation inside the OpenZeppelin GitHub: 
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/081776bf5fae2122bfda8a86d5369496adfdf959/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol#L37-L57

The `if()` statement checks that the balance of the contract is higher than the allowance. This doesn't necessarily means that the allowance is equal to zero. However, the safeApprove() will revert if the allowance is not zero.

`if (balance > IERC20Upgradeable(token).allowance(recipient, PREDICATE_ADDRESS)) {IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeApprove(PREDICATE_ADDRESS, MAX_INT);}`

## Impact

In the cases when `allowance != 0 ` the function will revert causing DoS.

## Recommendation

Use the `safeIncreaseAllowance()` function to make sure the function does not revert.
