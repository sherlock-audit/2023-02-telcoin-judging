# Blacklisted users lose funds even if they are unblacklisted

## Summary
When a user is blacklisted in `Stablecoin.sol`, `removeBlackFunds()` transfers all of the users' coins to the blacklister and they are not returned when the user is unblacklisted.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user `b` with `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` permissions can choose to blacklist a holder `h` of the Stablecoin by calling the `addBlackList()` function.
This in turn calls `removeBlackFunds()`, which transfers the stablecoins from `h`'s wallet to `b`'s wallet.
If `removeBlackList()` is called for user `h`, it stands to reason that `h` should be returned the funds that they had removed upon being blacklisted.

## Impact
Blacklisted user loses all of their funds even if blacklist is later removed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maintain a mapping of funds per address blacklisted and return if applicable on `removeBlackList()`.
This can be achieved either by transferring to the contract itself or through the burn/mint mechanism.
