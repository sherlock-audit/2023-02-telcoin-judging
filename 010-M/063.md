# Blacklist Front-Run

## Summary

Users who know they will be blacklisted can front-run admins by bribing block producers. The malicious user can then quickly swap the Telcoin stablecoin for Ethereum, which practically makes it impossible for Telcoin to seize digitally if a public mempool is used.

Funds in the hands of users who are deemed malicious can be seen as a loss of "authentic" funds. Possible future legal issues may also rise from negligence regarding blacklisted users (not legal advise, consult a lawyer).

A similar issue, and more information can be found [here](https://github.com/pashov/audits/blob/master/solo/CadmosFinance-security-review.md#m-03-front-running-risk-in-key-admin-actions).

## Vulnerability Detail

**Possible Path**
1. Alice is a very financially wealthy and cautious user who has a bot always examining the mempool for all possible blacklisting actions.
2.  Alice has done something "illicit or nefarious" - against Telcoin's policies ([possible OFAC example](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916)). Telcoin attempts to blacklist one of Alice's wallets.
3.  Alice does not have to worry as her bot automatically front-runs the `addBlackList` transaction submitted by Telcoin with a swap for Ethereum.
4.  Alice finds another stablecoin to avoid sanctions and swaps her Ethereum, possibly setting up her bot for the new token.

## Impact

Non-compliant "blacklisted" users can run away with funds if they have access to a mempool scanner.
