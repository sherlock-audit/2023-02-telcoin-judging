# Before `removePlugin`, the rewards that the user's due reward were not distributed

## Summary

Before `removePlugin`, the rewards that the user's due reward were not distributed.

## Vulnerability Detail

When PLUGIN_EDITOR_ROLE calls the `removePlugin` function, the corresponding Plugin will be deleted directly. This Plugin may still record the rewards won by the user. After the direct deletion, these rewards will be gone.

## Impact

The user's due reward is lost.
