# User cannot claim rewards after plugin removal

## Summary
When a plugin is removed, the user cannot claim rewards for that plugin. This is because the plugin is removed from the `pluginsMapping`, which is used to calculate the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `removePlugin` function, the plugin is removed from the `pluginsMapping`, without taking into account the rewards that the user has already earned with that plugin.

## Impact
Loss of the rewards that the user has already earned with that plugin.

## Code Snippet

This is the `removePlugin` function, which neither claims the rewards, nor checks if there are still rewards to claim.

```solidity
function removePlugin(uint256 index) external onlyRole(PLUGIN_EDITOR_ROLE) {
    address plugin = plugins[index];
    require(IPlugin(plugin).deactivated(), "StakingModule::removePlugin: Plugin is not deactivated");

    pluginsMapping[plugin] = false;
    pluginIndicies[plugin] = 0;
    plugins[index] = plugins[nPlugins - 1];
    pluginIndicies[plugins[index]] = index;
    plugins.pop();
    nPlugins--;

    emit PluginRemoved(plugin, nPlugins);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can soft delete the plugin and just mark it as deactivated. This way users can still claim their rewards.
