# BLACKLISTER_ROLE would be able to drain from all users to `himself`

## Summary
BLACKLISTER_ROLE would be able to drain from all users to `himself`
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever the BLACKLISTER_ROLE blacklists an address, they send the funds to themselves. In my opinion, it would be better to send the funds to the token address or introduce the owner's address.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change to token address or you can introduce admin address
```solidity
  function removeBlackFunds(address holder) internal {
    uint256 funds = balanceOf(holder);
-    _transfer(holder, _msgSender(), funds);
+    _transfer(holder, address(this), funds);

  }
```
