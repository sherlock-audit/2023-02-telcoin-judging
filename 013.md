# `RootBridgeRelay.sol` ether cannot be rescued.

## Summary
There is no method to resuce ether trapped in the `RootBridgeRelay.sol` if the bridge can't work.

## Vulnerability Detail
Because there is a `receive()` function in the contract, ether could become stuck in this contract. Although the `transferETHToBridge()` function can transfer ether to the bridge contract, it is important to note that the bridge contract is a proxy contract(you can see the contract code on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA0c68C638235ee32657e8f720a23ceC1bFc77C77#code)). Therefore, you cannot guarantee that the implementation will always function normally. Also if the bridge contract got hacked like Ronin, you can't transfer ether to bridge contract.

## Impact
Ether trapped in the contract cannot be rescued.
