# submit() fails to guarantee the amount transferred to the ``FeeBuyback`` contract is the same amount transferred to ``_referral``.

## Summary
``submit()`` fails to guarantee the amount transferred to the ``FeeBuyback`` contract is the same amount transferred to ``_referral``. 

## Vulnerability Detail

``submit()`` is used to submit wallet transactions. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/FeeBuyback.sol#L45-L83](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/FeeBuyback.sol#L45-L83)

However, the following block shows that ``submit()`` fails to guarantee the amount transferred to the ``FeeBuyback`` contract is the same amount transferred to ``_referral``.  It uses the amount of ``_telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))``, which should be ``amount`` instead. 

## Impact
Wong amount of Claimable will be increased by  ``increaseClaimableBy``. The correct amount should be ``amount``  instead of ``_telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))``.

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correction is as follows:
```diff
function submit(address wallet, bytes memory walletData, address safe, address token, address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes memory swapData) external override payable onlyOwner() returns (bool) {
    //wallet validity check
    require(wallet != address(0), "FeeBuyback: zero wallet");
    //Perform user swap first
    //Verify success
    (bool walletResult,) = wallet.call{value: 0}(walletData);
    require(walletResult, "FeeBuyback: wallet transaction failed");

    //check if this is a referral transaction
    //if not exit execution
    if (token == address(0) || recipient == address(0) || amount == 0 ) {
      return false;
    }

    //if swapped token is in TEL, no swap is necessary
    //do simple transfer from and submit
    if (token == address(_telcoin)) {
      _telcoin.safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
-      _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
+     _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), amount));

-      require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
+      require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, amount)), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");

      return true;
    }

    //MATIC does not allow for approvals
    //ERC20s only
    if (token != MATIC) {
      IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
      IERC20(token).safeApprove(_aggregator, 0);
      IERC20(token).safeApprove(_aggregator, amount);
    }

    //Perform secondary swap from fee token to TEL
    //do simple transfer from and submit
    (bool swapResult,) = _aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
    require(swapResult, "FeeBuyback: swap transaction failed");
    _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
    require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
    return true;
  }
