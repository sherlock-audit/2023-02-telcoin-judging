# Sandwich attack to submit transactions

## Summary
An attacker can use sandwich attack to ```FeeBuyback.submit()``` and make a profit.


## Vulnerability Detail
The ```FeeBuyback()``` protocol allows owner to submit wallet transactions. Inside the ```submit()``` function ,the protocol may swap the fee token to TEL on inch platform. Here sandwich attack is possible.
1.Bob front-runs ```FeeBuyback.submit()``` and uses a flash loan to borrow a large amount of fee token from third-party market and swap them to TEL token .This purchase raises the price of TEL and increases the slippage ( Expected price increase or decrease in price based on the volume to be traded and the available liquidity).
2.Owner calls calls ```submit()``` function , inside the function the protocol will swap the Fee token to TEL . Because of this high purchase of TEL, its price goes up, and owner buys at a higher price of TEL.
3.Bob sells TEL  at a higer price and make a profit.
```solidity
function submit(address wallet, bytes memory walletData, address safe, address token, address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes memory swapData) external override payable onlyOwner() returns (bool) {
    //wallet validity check
    require(wallet != address(0), "FeeBuyback: zero wallet");
    //Perform user swap first
    //Verify success
    (bool walletResult,) = wallet.call{value: 0}(walletData);
    require(walletResult, "FeeBuyback: wallet transaction failed");

    //check if this is a referral transaction
    //if not exit execution
    if (token == address(0) || recipient == address(0) || amount == 0 ) {
      return false;
    }

    //if swapped token is in TEL, no swap is necessary
    //do simple transfer from and submit
    if (token == address(_telcoin)) {
      _telcoin.safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
      _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
      require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
      return true;
    }

    //MATIC does not allow for approvals
    //ERC20s only
    if (token != MATIC) {
      IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
      IERC20(token).safeApprove(_aggregator, 0);
      IERC20(token).safeApprove(_aggregator, amount);
    }

    //Perform secondary swap from fee token to TEL
    //do simple transfer from and submit
    (bool swapResult,) = _aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
    require(swapResult, "FeeBuyback: swap transaction failed");
    _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
    require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
    return true;
  }

```

## Impact
The protocol will lose funds.
