# burnFrom in Stablecoin does not burn tokens without user prior approval

## Summary
burnFrom in Stablecoin does not burn tokens without user prior approval

## Vulnerability Detail
since burnFrom can only be called by BURNER_ROLE, the BURNER_ROLE has to have prior allowance from the account in order to call _burn. This contradicts the documentation which claims "Removes tokens from circulation from any address".

## Impact
does not have expected behavior according to intended usage

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
remove _spendAllowance, directly call _burn without first checking allowance if the BURNER_ROLE has such power without user approval
