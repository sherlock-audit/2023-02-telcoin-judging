# submit in FeeBuyBack is suggested to be constructed in calldata if no change is needed for gas saving

## Summary
submit in FeeBuyBack is suggested to be constructed in calldata if no change is needed 

## Vulnerability Detail
data without need to be modified is suggested to be structured using a struct and passed as calldata. This helps gas optimization.

[Example implementation is done in a parallel audit from Bond Protocol in sherlock](https://github.com/Bond-Protocol/bond-contracts/blob/master/src/bases/BondBaseSDA.sol#L140).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use a struct parameter to bundle all the necessary input data and passed as calldata.
