# use of safeApprove in submit on FeeBuyback is inconsistent among token and _telcoin

## Summary
use of safeApprove in FeeBuyback is inconsistent among token and _telcoin

## Vulnerability Detail
The `safeApprove` function should always be set to 0 first, and then set to the desired amount, if there is a possibility that the function would not consume all the approved quantity. In the `submit` function though, safeApprove on `token` has followed this practice, whereas a call from `_telcoin` has not, this creates confusion.

## Impact
inconsistent use of safeApprove.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `safeApprove` function should always be set to 0 first, and then set to the desired amount;
If both `_aggregator.call()` and `_referral.increaseClaimableBy()` guarantee to consume all allowance, then the resetting of safeApprove to 0 is unnecessary even before calling  `_aggregator.call()`. However the exact details is not transparent in this audit scope.
