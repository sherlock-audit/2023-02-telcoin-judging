# A reentrancy attack could be used to drain the contract's funds by exploiting the bridgeTransfer() function.

## Summary
A reentrancy attack on  `bridgeTransfer() `function could potentially occur if  `transferETHToBridge()` or `transferERCToBridge() `functions called back into  `bridgeTransfer()` function before completing their execution.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/bridge/RootBridgeRelay.sol#L39-49

Suppose an attacker deploys a malicious contract with the following code,
```solidity
contract MaliciousContract {
    TargetContract targetContract;
    
    constructor(address targetContractAddress) {
        targetContract = TargetContract(targetContractAddress);
    }
    
    function attack() public payable {
        targetContract.bridgeTransfer{value: msg.value}(ETHER_ADDRESS);
    }
    
    fallback() external payable {
        if (msg.sender == address(targetContract)) {
            targetContract.bridgeTransfer{value: msg.value}(ETHER_ADDRESS);
        }
    }
}
```
The `MaliciousContract` `constructor` takes the address of the `TargetContract` as an input parameter and saves a reference to it. `attack() `function calls the `bridgeTransfer()` function of `TargetContract `with  `ETHER_ADDRESS` parameter and sends along any ETH that was sent to  `attack() `function.

`fallback() `function is called if the `MaliciousContract` receives an _external call_ that does not match any other function signature. This function first checks if the sender is the `TargetContract`, and if it is, it calls `bridgeTransfer() `function of `TargetContract `with the `ETHER_ADDRESS` parameter and sends along any **ETH** that was sent to `fallback() `function.

Now suppose a user wants to transfer 1 ETH across the Polygon bridge and calls `bridgeTransfer()` function of  `TargetContract` with  `ETHER_ADDRESS ` parameter and 1 ETH. 

Here is what happens:

1.  `bridgeTransfer()` function is called with  `ETHER_ADDRESS` parameter and **1 ETH**.

2.  `transferETHToBridge() `function is called, which sends the 1 ETH to the _Polygon bridge_. 

3.  Before `transferETHToBridge()` function completes, the `fallback() `function of the `MaliciousContract` is called with the 1 ETH that was sent to  `TargetContract`.

4. ` fallback()` function calls the `bridgeTransfer() `function of the `TargetContract` with  `ETHER_ADDRESS` parameter and 1 ETH.

5. ` bridgeTransfer()` function is called again before the previous execution has been completed.

6.  ` transferETHToBridge()` function is called again, which sends another **1 ETH** to the Polygon bridge. 

7. Steps 3-6 repeat in a loop until there are no more funds left in the contract.

The attacker was able to repeatedly execute  `bridgeTransfer()`  function and drain the contract's funds by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability. This is because the `bridgeTransfer()` function did not have any mechanism to prevent reentrant calls before the previous execution had completed.


## Impact
The reentrancy issue in `bridgeTransfer() ` function can be severe, as an attacker can drain the contract's funds if he/she is successful in exploiting the vulnerability.

## Recommendation

  Use the `nonReentrant `modifier, this modifier can be used to prevent a function from being executed again until the previous execution has been completed.
