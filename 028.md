# reinitializer(2) is unnecessary in init on Stablecoin unless proxy has its own reinitailizer(1)

## Summary
reinitializer(2) is unnecessary in init on Stablecoin unless proxy has its own reinitailizer(1) #5

## Vulnerability Detail
`reinitializer` protects against initialisation by tracking the variable _initialized; In the implementation, `reinitializer(2)` would first verify _initialized is smaller than the passed version(2), then immediately set _initialized to 2 before executing. 

An example is u have a function A that is protected as `reinitializer(1)`; then a function B protected as `reinitializer(2)`.
A cannot be called once B is called. that's the purpose of reinitilizer, to establish sequential guarantee during initialising.

Once a call to init completes, `_initialized` would turn into 2 and no further init() can be called.

There is no need for using reinitializer(2); if the proxy does not have a function that is protected by reinitializer(1), and cannot be called after this init.

Moreover, depending if the implementation sits bejhind a UUPS or minimal proxy, the implementation should be initialized as well to prevent attacker from initialising it, even though this contract does not set any privilege user during initilization.

## Impact
behavior of init may not match expectation from the developer.
