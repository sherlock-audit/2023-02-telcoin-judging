# StakingModule's stakedByAt() can report erroneous values

## Summary

stakedByAt() is vulnerable to producing manipulated readings when staking was performed more than once in the same block.

For example, if there were two stake() calls in one block, then stakedByAt() will report the state resulting from only the first one due to Checkpoints returning the value of the first checkpoint of the block.

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently only exiting can't be carried out more than once in the same block, staking can happen more than once.

This will yield lower than actual stakedByAt() and balanceOfAt() readings whenever several staking calls happened in one block.

## Impact

Erroneous readings can and most probably will impact downstream systems and can lead to their user's losses.

Reading other system's balance is a common component of decision making in a typical Vault contract. StakingModule can be a strategy therein and readings of the current holdings of the Vault will impact the course of its actions. Vault can have been depositing more than once in a block say as a result of actions of their users, for example it could been two deposits from different users in the same block, and parts of each of them was staked with StakingModule. 

By having stakedByAt() reported value associated with the first deposit only, StakingModule biases the actions of the Vault, which can lead to losses for its users and then to removal of Telcoin integration, which is loss of market share that can later translates to Telcoin value.

## Code Snippet

Historical requests used in stakedByAt() are vulnerable to stale Checkpoints readings:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L218-L223

```solidity
    /// @return Amount staked by an account at a specific block number excluding claimable yield.
    /// @param account Account to query staked amount
    /// @param blockNumber Block at which to query staked amount
    function stakedByAt(address account, uint256 blockNumber) public view returns (uint256) {
        return _stakes[account].getAtBlock(blockNumber);
    }
```

stakedByAt() is used for historical balance readings:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L174-L176

```solidity
    function balanceOfAt(address account, uint256 blockNumber, bytes calldata auxData) external view returns (uint256) {
        return stakedByAt(account, blockNumber) + claimableAt(account, blockNumber, auxData);
    }
```

checkpointProtection() is added to some functions (_partialExit() and _claimAndExit()), but _stake() is left unprotected:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin-judging/issues/83

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L109-L113

```solidity
    modifier checkpointProtection(address account) {
        uint256 numCheckpoints = _stakes[account]._checkpoints.length;
        require(numCheckpoints == 0 || _stakes[account]._checkpoints[numCheckpoints - 1]._blockNumber != block.number, "StakingModule: Cannot exit in the same block as another stake or exit");
        _;
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L429-L439

```solidity
    function _stake(address account, address from, uint256 amount) private {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0");

        uint256 stakedBefore = _stakes[account].latest();
        uint256 stakedAfter = stakedBefore + amount;

        // notify plugins
        _notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins(account, stakedBefore, stakedAfter);
        
        // update _stakes
        _stakes[account].push(stakedAfter);
```

I.e. what currently implemented is a fix for the flash loan vector, but stakedByAt() readings can still be wrong.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding the checkpointProtection() check to _stake():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L429-L439

```diff
-   function _stake(address account, address from, uint256 amount) private {
+   function _stake(address account, address from, uint256 amount) private checkpointProtection(account) {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0");

        uint256 stakedBefore = _stakes[account].latest();
        uint256 stakedAfter = stakedBefore + amount;

        // notify plugins
        _notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins(account, stakedBefore, stakedAfter);
        
        // update _stakes
        _stakes[account].push(stakedAfter);
```

This way both staking and unstaking will be restricted to once per block due to the usage of Checkpoints, which needs to be documented as a known limitation.
