# Users Can Bypass the Delayed Withdrawal

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Call request withdraw(). Note that you donâ€™t need any funds deposited to call the request withdraw() function.
This will set withdrawRequestTimestamps of msg.sedner to the current blockTimestamps.
After time has elapsed, we deposit.
This deposit does not reset withdrawRequestTimestamps, and the time is cacluated as if the user had deposited at the time they initially called the first withdraw()

## Impact

The modifier is bypassed, slashing can be frontrun.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make sure that the withdrawRequestTimestamp is updated with important state-changing function
