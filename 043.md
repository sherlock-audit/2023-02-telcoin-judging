# Multiple roles can directly steal user funds

## Summary

Note: I submitted this as high, as these are roles that are not supposed to be able to rug people's funds. They strongly violate the principle of least privilege.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are 3 roles in the contract that can be used to transfer funds to themselves:

SLASHER_ROLE
BURNER_ROLE
BLACKLISTER_ROLE

## Impact

3 seperate roles/addresses which can steal user funds for profit.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove these roles altogether, change these to multisigs or reduce their level of privilege.
