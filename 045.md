# bridgeTransfer function using the entire balance instead of the transferred amount

## Summary
The bridgeTransfer function uses the entire balance of the contract instead of the transferred amount when bridging Ether or ERC20 tokens. This may lead to unintended behavior and potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the bridgeTransfer function, when Ether or ERC20 tokens are transferred, the contract uses the entire balance of the contract instead of the transferred amount for the bridging process. This can cause issues if multiple users deposit tokens or Ether before the bridge transfer is executed, as the entire balance would be sent instead of the individual deposit amounts.

## Impact
Using the entire balance instead of the transferred amount may result in unintended behavior and potential loss of funds for the users, as it combines the funds of multiple users during the bridge transfer process.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the bridgeTransfer function to accept an additional parameter, amount, representing the amount of Ether or tokens to be transferred. Update the transferETHToBridge and transferERCToBridge functions to use the transferred amount instead of the entire balance.
``` solidity
function bridgeTransfer(address token, uint256 amount) external override payable {
    ...
    if (token == ETHER_ADDRESS) {
      transferETHToBridge(amount);
    } else {
      transferERCToBridge(token, amount);
    }
}

function transferETHToBridge(uint256 amount) internal {
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    POS_BRIDGE.depositEtherFor{value: amount}(recipient);
    emit BridgeETH(recipient, amount);
}

function transferERCToBridge(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
    uint256 balance = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    ...
    POS_BRIDGE.depositFor(recipient, token, abi.encodePacked(amount));
    emit BridgeERC(recipient, token, amount);
}```
