# ERC20 tokens can not be rescued

## Summary

Any ERC20 tokens stuck in the contract can not be rescued.

## Vulnerability Detail

The implementation of the `erc20Rescue()` function is intended to allow the owner of the contract to withdraw any tokens left in the contract. As we can see from the [list](https://tokenlists.org/token-list?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telcoin/token-lists/master/telcoins.json), the Telcoin protocol supports different tokens which might be stuck in the contract for all sorts of reasons. The problem is that the `erc20Rescue()` function allows the owner to withdraw only the Matic tokens left in the contract as the Matic address is hard coded.

```solidity
  function erc20Rescue(address destination, uint256 amount) external  {
    require(msg.sender == _owner, "RootBridgeRelay: caller must be owner");
    MATIC_ADDRESS.safeTransfer(destination, amount);
  }
```
## Impact

The leftover ERC20 tokens trapped in the contract can not be rescued.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a method that enables the owner to rescue all of the different ERC20 tokens which are supported by the protocol. This could be simply adding another `address _token` parameter to the `erc20Rescue` which could be used instead of the hard-coded Matic address.
