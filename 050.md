# minWithdrawalWindow can be zero

## Summary
- `minWithdrawalWindow` can be zero, possibly resulting in user being able to withdraw their tokens immediately after staking.
- `maxWithdrawalDelay` can be zero, possibly resulting in the money getting stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
No checks are performed on the `minWithdrawalWindow` or `maxWithdrawalDelay` variables, which can be set to zero. This can lead to users being able to withdraw their tokens immediately after staking, or the money getting stuck in the contract.

## Impact
Either users can withdraw their tokens immediately after staking, or the money gets stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
This is the `initialize` function, which does not check if the `minWithdrawalWindow` or `maxWithdrawalDelay` variables are zero.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L96

```solidity
function initialize(address _telAddress, uint256 _maxWithdrawalDelay, uint256 _minWithdrawalWindow) public initializer {
    tel = _telAddress;
    maxWithdrawalDelay = _maxWithdrawalDelay;
    minWithdrawalWindow = _minWithdrawalWindow;

    // initialize OZ stuff
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.__ReentrancyGuard_init_unchained();
    AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable.__AccessControlEnumerable_init_unchained();

    // set deployer as ADMIN
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add two checks to the `initialize` function, to make sure that the `minWithdrawalWindow` and `maxWithdrawalDelay` variables are not zero and are within a certain range.
