# Over rewarding the user

## Summary
Some plugins require a notification on user's stake amount change, but if sending the notification fails, we just let the user withdraw their stake without the plugin being notified.

The user will keep receiving rewards for the stake that they have already withdrawn.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins` function, there is a try catch block, which catches the error if we fail to send the notification to a plugin that requires it. But the catch block does not revert the transaction, so the user can withdraw their stake without the plugin being notified.

## Impact
The user will keep receiving rewards for the stake that they have already withdrawn.

## Code Snippet
This is the `_notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins` function, which does not revert the transaction if we fail to send the notification to a plugin that requires it.

```solidity
function _notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins(address account, uint256 amountBefore, uint256 amountAfter) private {
    // loop over all plugins
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < nPlugins; i++) {
        // only notify if the plugin requires
        if (IPlugin(plugins[i]).requiresNotification()) {
            try IPlugin(plugins[i]).notifyStakeChange(account, amountBefore, amountAfter) {}
            catch {
                emit StakeChangeNotificationFailed(plugins[i]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can revert the transaction if we fail to send the notification to a plugin that requires it by removing the try catch block.
