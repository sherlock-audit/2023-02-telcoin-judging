# Race condition in some functions

## Summary
Users transactions that are in the mempool might accidentally get front run by the `removePlugin` function, which can lead to incorrect results.

## Vulnerability Detail
Many functions like `_claim`, `claimable`, `claimableAt`, `totalSupply`, and `_notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins` depend on the order of the plugins in the `plugins` array. If the order of the plugins is changed, the results of these functions will be incorrect.

And the `removePlugin` function changes the order of the plugins in the `plugins` array, which can lead to incorrect results for users.

So whenever the `PLUGIN_EDITOR_ROLE` decides to remove a plugin it might by accident front run users transactions that are already in the mempool, which can lead to incorrect results.

## Impact
Users transactions resulting in an unpredicted outcome or failing.

## Code Snippet

This is the `removePlugin` function, which changes the order of the plugins in the `plugins` array.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L543-L555
```solidity
function removePlugin(uint256 index) external onlyRole(PLUGIN_EDITOR_ROLE) {
    address plugin = plugins[index];
    require(IPlugin(plugin).deactivated(), "StakingModule::removePlugin: Plugin is not deactivated");

    pluginsMapping[plugin] = false;
    pluginIndicies[plugin] = 0;
    plugins[index] = plugins[nPlugins - 1];
    pluginIndicies[plugins[index]] = index;
    plugins.pop();
    nPlugins--;

    emit PluginRemoved(plugin, nPlugins);
}
```

And this is one of the examples of a function relying on the order of the plugins in the `plugins` array.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L187-L195
```solidity
function claimable(address account, bytes calldata auxData) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 total;
    // loop over all plugins, sum claimable of account
    bytes[] memory parsedAuxData = parseAuxData(auxData);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < nPlugins; i++) {
        total += IPlugin(plugins[i]).claimable(account, parsedAuxData[i]);
    }
    return total;
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can do a two step deletion, first marking a plugin to remove in the future and then actually remove it after a certain amount of time. This way users can still claim their rewards in a predictable manner.
