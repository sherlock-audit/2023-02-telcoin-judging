# `setWithdrawDelayAndWindow()` should not affect already requested withdrawal

## Summary

The setter function should not have backwards effects. The already requested withdraw potentially can be affected, this logic is not appropriate and could lead to user loss. User fund could be lock and unable to withdraw due to the admin setter function. Malicious admin can lock users fund forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

Imagine the following:
1. initially, timestamp start with 1,000,000, the `withdrawalDelay` is 3,000 and `withdrawalWindow` is 200.
2. Bob `requestWithdrawal()` at the beginning, `withdrawalRequestTimestamps[Bob]` is 1,000,000, the available window for Bob to withdraw is 1,003,000 to 1,003,200.
3. at timestamp 1,002,980, the admin call `setWithdrawDelayAndWindow()` to set `withdrawalDelay` to be 100 and `withdrawalWindow` to be 20. The available window for Bob to withdraw immediately becomes 1,000,100 to 1,000,120. The current time already passed the available window. Bob's last request to withdraw is voided.
4. if Bob request again at 1,003,000, the window will be 1,003,100 to 1,003,120. But at 1,003,090, the admin can call `setWithdrawDelayAndWindow()` again to set `withdrawalDelay` back to 3,000 and `withdrawalWindow` 200, Bob has to wait again. 

The above could be repeated, and potentially Bob might not to withdraw forever, if the admin is malicious.

The issue lies in the system logic, the changes to the system should not have effects on the past status. To be consistent and avoid confusion, all changes should only act on future status. In this case, the changes of delay and window parameters can immediately alter the withdraw request in the past, which could result in users fund loss and other confusion.


## Impact

User's request for withdraw could be voided by admin's `setWithdrawDelayAndWindow()`. Malicious admin could lock users' fund forever if call the setter function back and forth.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When admin calls `setWithdrawDelayAndWindow()`, the setter should not have effects on the already requested withdrawal. As the user request withdraw, the spot `withdrawalDelay` and `withdrawalWindow` should be recorded and fixed, not altered by future admin setter functions.
