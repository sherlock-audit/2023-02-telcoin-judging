# Native Tokens can be lost and cannot be rescued

## Summary
Users can accidentally send native tokens along with ERC20 tokens due to lack of input validation & native tokens can be lost due to the dependency on `address(this).balance` and there is no method to rescue native tokens trapped in the `RootBridgeRelay` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
**(1)** A user can accidentally call the [`RootBridgeRelay.bridgeTransfer()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/bridge/RootBridgeRelay.sol#L39) function with non-`ETHER_ADDRESS` and sent native funds along ERC20 tokens, as the `payable` function `bridgeTransfer()` doesn't make sure that `msg.value` when token address is non-`ETHER_ADDRESS`. The user will lose the funds and **(2)** the funds will end up frozen in the contract as there is no way to withdraw() those funds. **(3)** Those funds will be lost (minted as WETH to the recipient address, as per the [comments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/bridge/RootBridgeRelay.sol#L53)) if anyone calls `bridgeTransfer()` with `ETHER_ADDRESS`, due to the [`RootBridgeRelay.transferETHToBridge()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/bridge/RootBridgeRelay.sol#L55)'s dependency on the `address(this).balance`.
```solidity
  function bridgeTransfer(address token) external override payable {
    if (IERC20Upgradeable(token) == MATIC_ADDRESS) {
      revert MATICUnbridgeable();
    }

    if (token == ETHER_ADDRESS) {
      transferETHToBridge();
    } else {
      transferERCToBridge(token);
    }
  }
```
```solidity
  function transferETHToBridge() internal {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    POS_BRIDGE.depositEtherFor{value: balance}(recipient);
    emit BridgeETH(recipient, balance);
  }
```
 
## Impact
- Users' funds' locked/loss
- Ethers Locked on the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Make sure that users don't send any native funds along with the ERC20 tokens:
```diff
  function bridgeTransfer(address token) external override payable {
    if (IERC20Upgradeable(token) == MATIC_ADDRESS) {
      revert MATICUnbridgeable();
    }

    if (token == ETHER_ADDRESS) {
      transferETHToBridge();
    } else {
+   require(msg.value == 0, "Native Funds sent along ERC20 Tokens");
      transferERCToBridge(token);
    }
 }
```
2. Add a Ethers withdraw function like `erc20rescue`:
```solidity
  function ethersRescue(address destination) external  {
    require(msg.sender == _owner, "RootBridgeRelay: caller must be owner");
    (bool success, ) = destination.call{value: address(this).balance}();
    require(success, "Ethers Rescue failed");
  }
```
3. Don't depend on `address(this).balance`, use `msg.value`:
```diff
  function transferETHToBridge() internal {
-    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
+   uint256 balance = msg.value;
    POS_BRIDGE.depositEtherFor{value: balance}(recipient);
    emit BridgeETH(recipient, balance);
  }
```
