# Funds are not returned when user is removed from blacklist

## Summary

Blacklisted funds are not returned when the user is removed from blacklist

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user is involved in any illegal activities, the user is blacklisted and funds are transferred to the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` address. 
But when the user is removed from the blacklist, funds are not returned to the user.
And if the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` address is malicious, then the user can blacklist any address and steal funds

## Impact

Loss of funds for the user
