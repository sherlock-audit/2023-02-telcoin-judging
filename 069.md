# Low level call returns true if the address doesn't exist

## Summary

In submit function of the FeeBuyback contract, require to check the success of low-level calls, but will return `true` anyway even if the transaction fails or returns, causing the require statement to pass incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the submit function, the following low-level call is made:
`(bool walletResult,) = wallet.call{value: 0}(walletData);`
This line can return true even if the transaction fails or reverts. As a result, the following require statement might pass even when the transaction has not been successful:
`require(walletResult, "FeeBuyback: wallet transaction failed");`

## Impact

This problem can cause the function to continue even if the wallet transaction fails. This can lead to unexpected behavior, and this problem must be resolved in order for the contract to function as intended.
