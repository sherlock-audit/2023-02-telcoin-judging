# Fee can be paid even if the transaction fails in some circumstances

## Summary

If the wallet address is 1 bit of the address will most likely be an EOA and the `call()` will return true, the fee will still be paid even though the user swap did not actually happen.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `submit()` function does check if the `wallet != 0` but a more likely mistake is a random bit error which would most likely lead to an EOA. If the wallet is an EOA the call on [L55](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/FeeBuyback.sol#L45-L51) would return true even though a swap never happened. The transaction will proceed and the fee will be paid.

## Impact

Paying fee even when a swap is not actually performed. This would only lead to loss of a large amount if this is happens due to a re-occurring faulty call.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make sure that `wallet` is a contract by adding the following check: 

```solidity
wallet.code.length>0
```
