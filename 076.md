# Zero address blacklist in token contract prevents burning tokens

## Summary
In the Stablecoin contract, addBlackList function, if the zero address is added to the _blacklist, the burn function will not be able to transfer tokens from any address to the zero address. This means that the token will not be able to be burned until the zero address is removed from the blacklist.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the zero address is added to the _blacklist, the burn function will not be able to transfer tokens to the zero address because the zero address is now blacklisted. As a result, it would not be possible to burn tokens until the zero address is removed from the blacklist.

## Impact
If the zero address is added to the blacklist, it would not be possible to burn tokens.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
solidity function addBlackList(address holder) external onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) override {
    if (blacklisted(holder)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(holder);
    _blacklist[holder] = true;
    emit AddedBlacklist(holder);
    removeBlackFunds(holder);
}

function burn(uint256 amount) public override onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {
    _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
}
```
