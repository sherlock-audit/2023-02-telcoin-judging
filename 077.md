# The previously founded issue was not fixed

## Summary
Issue from the previous audit still exists.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin-judging/issues/76

## Vulnerability Detail
Nothing was added to synchronize `msg.value` and `amount`.

## Impact
Net impact is a fund loss proportional to the difference of the amount and msg.value. This can be either incomplete setup (native funds case isn't fully covered in a calling script) or an operational mistake (it is covered correctly, but a wrong value was occasionally left from a testing, and so on) situation.

## Code Snippet
`submit()` uses `msg.value`, which can differ from `amount`:
```solidity
   function submit(address wallet, bytes memory walletData, address safe, address token, address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes memory swapData) external override payable onlyOwner() returns (bool) {
    //wallet validity check
    require(wallet != address(0), "FeeBuyback: zero wallet");
    //Perform user swap first
    //Verify success
    (bool walletResult,) = wallet.call{value: 0}(walletData);
    require(walletResult, "FeeBuyback: wallet transaction failed");

    //check if this is a referral transaction
    //if not exit execution
    if (token == address(0) || recipient == address(0) || amount == 0 ) {
      return false;
    }

    //if swapped token is in TEL, no swap is necessary
    //do simple transfer from and submit
    if (token == address(_telcoin)) {
      _telcoin.safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
      _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
      require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
      return true;
    }

    //MATIC does not allow for approvals
    //ERC20s only
    if (token != MATIC) {
      IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
      IERC20(token).safeApprove(_aggregator, 0);
      IERC20(token).safeApprove(_aggregator, amount);
    }

    //Perform secondary swap from fee token to TEL
    //do simple transfer from and submit
    (bool swapResult,) = _aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
    require(swapResult, "FeeBuyback: swap transaction failed");
    _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
    require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
    return true;
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to maintain the uniform approach consider requiring that amount does exactly correspond to msg.value, when MATIC is used, for example:
```diff
    if (token != MATIC) {
      IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
      IERC20(token).safeApprove(_aggregator, 0);
      IERC20(token).safeApprove(_aggregator, amount);
+   } else {
+     require(amount == msg.value, "FeeBuyback: wrong amount");    
    }
```
