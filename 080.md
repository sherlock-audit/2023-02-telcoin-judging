# FeeBuyback.submit do not revert on non-zero msg.value

## Summary

A user wanting to bridge ERC20 tokens would lose all ETH accidentally send to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In case the token is ERC20, there is no check that msg.value == 0

## Impact

This leads to the ETH sent accidentally by a user being held unaccounted for in the contract and being lost for the user.
