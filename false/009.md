# transferERCToBridge() might not work for some ERC20 tokens such as USDT

## Summary
 ``transferERCToBridge()`` might not work for some ERC20 tokens such as USDT.  This is because one cannot change the allowance of USDT from non-zero to non-zero. One needs to change the allowance to zero first and then change it to the desired amount. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The  ``transferERCToBridge()``  function allows one to transfer ERC20 tokens over the bridge. One needs to approve PREDICATE_ADDRESS the needed amount allowance. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/bridge/RootBridgeRelay.sol#L67-L72](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/bridge/RootBridgeRelay.sol#L67-L72)

However, one cannot change the allowance of tokens such as USDT from non-zero to non-zero. One needs to change the allowance to zero first and then change it to the desired amount. 

## Impact
 ``transferERCToBridge()`` might not work for some ERC20 tokens such as USDT.  This is because one cannot change the allowance of USDT from non-zero to non-zero. One needs to change the allowance to zero first and then change it to the desired amount.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We need to change the allowance to zero first before changing it to the needed amount.
```diff
function transferERCToBridge(address token) internal {
    uint256 balance = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));
-    if (balance > IERC20Upgradeable(token).allowance(recipient, PREDICATE_ADDRESS)) -{IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeApprove(PREDICATE_ADDRESS, MAX_INT);}
+    if (balance > IERC20Upgradeable(token).allowance(recipient, PREDICATE_ADDRESS)) 
+ {
+  IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeApprove(PREDICATE_ADDRESS,  0);  
+
+   IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeApprove(PREDICATE_ADDRESS, MAX_INT);
+ }

    POS_BRIDGE.depositFor(recipient, token, abi.encodePacked(balance));
    emit BridgeERC(recipient, token, balance);
  }

```
