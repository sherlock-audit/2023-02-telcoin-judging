# maxInt is used for approval during transferERCToBridge to a third-party upgradeable bridge in RootBridgeRelay is unnecessary

## Summary
maxInt is used for approval during transferERCToBridge in RootBridgeRelay is unnecessary

## Vulnerability Detail
During transferERCToBridge in RootBridgeRelay, if the allowance from the Relay to the predicate is below the balance to transfer (probably the first time for this particular token),  the relay would then approve a maxInt for the predicate. If the polygon bridge got attacked this would have ripple effect to the relay.

## Impact
unnecessary vulnerability to `Predicate` which is a bridge ran on ethereum by [Hop Protocol](https://github.com/hop-protocol/hop/blob/develop/packages/core/src/addresses/mainnet.ts), an external dependency that is upgradeable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the existing balance as the approved amount each time a user initialise a transfer. The amount would be consumed in 1-go without affecting other user on the relay.
