# _stakes[account] in StakingModule stores a struct Histroy which got inappropriately pushed an uint256 amount.

## Summary
`_stakes[account]` in `StakingModule` stores an array of Checkpoints which got inappropriately pushed an `uint256` amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
StakingModule uses CheckpointsUpgradeable from Openzeppelin to conduct checkpoint for staking operation. Each user address maps to a History struct which is an array of checkpoints.

Checkpoint is a carefully packed struct with 2 variables, namely `uin32 blockNumber, uint224 _value`;

In the StakingModule, this array of checkpoints got pushed a uint256 directly which represent the updated stakedAmount of user, without considering the blockNumber, this is not the intended usage.

[Checkpoint on Openzeppelin CheckpointsUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/CheckpointsUpgradeable.sol#L24)

## Impact
`Checkpoint.latest()` would return a false number by referencing the first 32 bits of the pushed value as the blockNumber,  `Checkpoint.latest()` is used multiple times in the `StakingModule` as a way to return the `stakedAmt`; However the return value is only the lower 224 bits according to the Documentation. This would completely make the returned amount different from the value which was pushed.

## Code Snippet
There are three places where this push occur.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
import the struct `Checkpoint` from CheckpointsUpgradeable; and push an instance of checkpoint with both value and blockNumber clearly specified. (uint32, uint224)

```solidity
struct Checkpoint {
        uint32 _blockNumber;
        uint224 _value;
    }

uint32 currentBlock = block.number;
uint224 stakedAmount;
require(stakedAmount <= 2 ** 224 - 1, "_value is stored as uint224");
Checkpoint c = Checkpoint(currentBlock, stakedAmount);
[_stakes].account.push(c);
```
