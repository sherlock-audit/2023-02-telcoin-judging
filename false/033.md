# Blacklisted Address Fund Transfer Issue in Stablecoin Contract

## Summary

A blacklisted address's funds should not be sent to `_msgSender()`, who is someone with BLACKLISTER_ROLE.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `removeBlackFunds(holder)` function, which is called when an `address` is added to the blacklist using the `addBlackList(holder)` function. The current implementation transfers the blacklisted address's funds to the `_msgSender()`, rather than a dedicated multisig/treasury address.

## Impact

This issue could result in the misuse of power by the admin, who has the BLACKLISTER_ROLE. When the admin blacklists an address, they would receive the blacklisted address's funds. Moreover, if the admin's account becomes compromised, the attacker could misuse this functionality to blacklist innocent addresses and steal their funds. 

This issue is very severe because blacklisted addresses can be un-blacklisted; however, lost funds cannot be recovered.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Declare a dedicated multi-sig wallet as a fund recovery address and remove the blacklisted fund there. Here are some recommended changes.

```diff
     string private _symbol;
     uint8 private _decimals;
     string private _description;
+    address public treasury;
```

```diff
     function init(
         string memory name_,
         string memory symbol_,
         uint8 decimal_,
-        string memory description_
+        string memory description_,
+        address treasury_
     ) external reinitializer(2) {
         __ERC20PresetMinterPauser_init(name_, symbol_);
         __ERC20Permit_init(name_);
         _symbol = symbol_;
         _decimals = decimal_;
         _description = description_;
+        treasury = treasury_;
     }

```

```diff
+    function updateTreasury(
+        address treasury_
+    ) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)  
{
+        treasury = treasury_;
+    }
+
```

```diff
     function removeBlackFunds(address holder) internal {
         uint256 funds = balanceOf(holder);
-        _transfer(holder, _msgSender(), funds);
+        _transfer(holder, treasury, funds);
     }

```
