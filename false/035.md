# Incorrect Claimable Balance Adjustment possible in FeeBuyback  `submit` function

## Summary

The FeeBuyBack contract's `submit` function may incorrectly update recipients' claimable balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem is related to the following line of code, which appears a couple of times in the `submit` function.

```solidity
require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balance(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
```
The issue is that the Telcoin token balance of the contract might be higher than what the claimable amount should be. This may happen if some tokens are accidentally sent to the contract address. So the claimable amount will be higher than what is available.

Consider the following scenario:

1. Someone accidentally sends 1000 Telcoin to the FeeBuyback contract.
2. A submit function call occurs when the extra Telcoin is still in the contract.
3. The recipient of the `submit` call can now claim an extra 1000 Telecoin.
4. Now the extra `Telcoin` funds can not be recovered anymore because it would've been transferred to the referer contract.



## Impact

The impact of this issue is that recipients might receive more tokens than they are supposed to when claiming rewards. This could lead to an unintentional distribution of tokens.

## Code Snippet
First Occurance:
[Link to Github code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/FeeBuyback.sol#L64)

```solidity
 if (token == address(_telcoin)) {
      _telcoin.safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
      _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
      require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
      return true;
    }
```
Second Occurance:
[Link to Github code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/FeeBuyback.sol#L81)

```solidity
   (bool swapResult,) = _aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
    require(swapResult, "FeeBuyback: swap transaction failed");
    _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
    require(_referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))), "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted");
    return true;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix the issue, the following changes should be made in the submit function:


When the token is `telcoin`  just use `amount` to `approve` the referer contract and also the claimable amount of the recipient. 

```diff

         if (token == address(_telcoin)) {
             _telcoin.safeTransferFrom(safe, address(this), amount);
-            _telcoin.safeApprove(
-                address(_referral),
-                _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))
-            );
+            _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), amount);
             require(
-                _referral.increaseClaimableBy(
-                    recipient,
-                    _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))
-                ),
+                _referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, amount),
                 "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted"
             );
             return true;

```

For the secondary swap scenario, calculate the difference between the Telcoin balance of the contract before and after the swap.

```diff
       //Perform secondary swap from fee token to TEL
         //do simple transfer from and submit
+        uint256 balanceBefore = _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this));
         (bool swapResult, ) = _aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
         require(swapResult, "FeeBuyback: swap transaction failed");
-        _telcoin.safeApprove(
-            address(_referral),
-            _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))
-        );
+        uint256 swappedAmount = _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)) -
+            balanceBefore;
+        _telcoin.safeApprove(address(_referral), swappedAmount);
         require(
-            _referral.increaseClaimableBy(
-                recipient,
-                _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))
-            ),
+            _referral.increaseClaimableBy(recipient, swappedAmount),
             "FeeBuyback: balance was not adjusted"
         );
         return true;

```
