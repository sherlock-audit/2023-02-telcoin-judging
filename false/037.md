# Hard-Coded Owner

## Summary

Ownership is hard-coded in `RootBridgeRelay.sol` which can result in locked funds if an internal wallet change is necessary or keys are lost given owner functionality. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_owner` state variable in `RootBridgeRelay.sol` is hardcoded as `0x0711871682A45c256ECA5AEB477C0057AE9c5509`. `erc20Rescue` strictly relies on a `_owner` caller to function. As described in the protocol, `erc20Rescue`: 
> "helps recover MATIC which cannot be bridged with POS bridge".

## Impact

In the case of an internal restructuring with the `_owner` wallet or a loss of keys, the `erc20Rescue` functionality would end. All lost MATIC will be lost forever.
