# Usign strict equality can lead to Denial of Service/Breaking of Claim Contract

## Summary

The strict equality is supposed to ensure that the function is working correctly. Instead it could break the withdrawal of the contract resulting in locked funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The check makes the contract more vulnerable. When a mismatch of the functions happens, the call will always revert and funds will be stuck in the contract.

`        require(IERC20Upgradeable(tel).balanceOf(to) - balBefore == total, "one or more plugins did not send appropriate token amount");
`

With this strict equality, a deviation of only 1 unit in any one of the plugins can cause the entire function to reapeatedly fail, as the _claim loops through the same plugins every time. This effectively locks the users funds.

## Impact

If one of the Plugins fails, the withdraw contract will be unable to withdraw funds.

## Recommendation
