# User suffers excess withdrawal delay

## Summary
User might suffer excess delay, because his withdraw transaction does not fail when it should.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `delayedWithdrawal` modifier we set the `withdrawalRequestTimestamps` of the user to zero, resetting his withdrawal request. So if the user calls to withdraw the stake, with amount=0, since the transaction does not fail, and will simply return, the user has to create a new withdrawal request, wait for the delay period to pass, and then call the withdraw function again.

## Impact
User will suffer more delay to withdraw his stakes than he actually should.

## Code Snippet

Here is the `delayedWithdrawal` modifier, which resets the `withdrawalRequestTimestamps` of the user to zero before calling the function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L115-L124

```solidity
modifier delayedWithdrawal() {
    require(withdrawalDelay == 0 || (
            withdrawalRequestTimestamps[msg.sender] + withdrawalDelay <= block.timestamp &&
            block.timestamp <= withdrawalRequestTimestamps[msg.sender] + withdrawalDelay + withdrawalWindow
        ),
        "StakingModule: Withdrawal not requested yet or it is too early/late to withdraw"
    );
    withdrawalRequestTimestamps[msg.sender] = 0;
    _;
}
```

And here is the first few lines of the `_partialExit` function, which does not revert the transaction if the user tries to withdraw zero amount, and simply returns.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L396-L418

```solidity
function _partialExit(address account, address to, uint256 exitAmount) private checkpointProtection(account) {
    if (exitAmount == 0) {
        return;
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
if the amount is zero, revert.
