# Claim functions can be blocked

## Summary
Registering many Plugins can block claim from plugins
## Vulnerability Detail
```StakingModule#_claim()``` iterates over unbounded number of plugins.
## Impact
Makes revert all functions with claim logic, except ```claimFromIndividualPlugin()```.
I believe this is a High issue, because users' funds under the danger when all this plugins can't be removed by PLUGIN_EDITOR (because they are activated)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add pagination to ```_claim()``` and update functions which use``` _claim()```. Or refactor the logic of claim from multiple Plugins
