# StakingModule.sol Exit of every user can be blocked

## Summary
Users' funds can get stuck in contract due to revert in ```_notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins()```
## Vulnerability Detail
```_notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins()``` iterates over unbounded number of Plugins, making it possible to notify due to "Out of gas" error
## Impact
It stucks every user's staked coins in contract, making it impossible to withdraw. I believe this is a High issue, because users' funds under the danger when all this plugins can't be removed by PLUGIN_EDITOR (because they are activated)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create mapping(address account => Plugin[]), and iterate only account's Plugins. If number of Plugins by account is still big - refactor Plugin's logic
