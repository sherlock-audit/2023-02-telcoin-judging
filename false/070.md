# There is no sufficient check for the plugin to return the right amount of yield

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no sufficient check for the plugin to return the right amount of earned yield

## Impact

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L325-L343


In the [_claimFromIndividualPlugin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L325) function, if the balBefore = 10  and xClaimed = 7 (assuming the user didnâ€™t claim all)

The [require statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/staking/StakingModule.sol#L335) checks that IERC20Upgradeable(tel).balanceOf(to) - balBefore == xClaimed and return an error statement if this is not correct

Now, if balBefore = 10, xclaimed = 7 then the balanceOf(to) after xclaimed  will be 3

Going by the calculation in the require statement  will result in 

3-10 = -7, resulting in an underflow and will revert except if user claimed all their earned yield

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This should fixed the issue

uint256 balanceAfter = balBefore - IERC20Upgradeable(tel).balanceOf(to) ;

require( balanceAfter == xClaimed, "The plugin did not send appropriate token amount");
