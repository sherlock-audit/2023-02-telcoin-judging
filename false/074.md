# Lack of balance check in erc20Rescue function

## Summary
The erc20Rescue function in the Stablecoin contract allows tokens accidentally sent to the contract to be returned to the rightful owner but a user with SUPPORT_ROLE can transfer more tokens than are available at the destination address.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises due to the lack of a check to ensure that the amount parameter is less than or equal to the balance of the destination address before executing the safeTransfer function. An attacker with SUPPORT_ROLE can exploit this vulnerability by transferring more tokens than are available at the destination address.
## Impact
For some reason like mistaking enter the amount or hacked SUPPORT_ROLE address, successfully can happen transfer more tokens than are available at the destination address, resulting in a loss of funds for the rightful owner of the tokens.

```solidity 
solidity function erc20Rescue(IERC20Upgradeable token, address destination, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) {
    token.safeTransfer(destination, amount);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider additional checks to ensure that the amount parameter is less than or equal to the balance of the destination address before executing the safeTransfer function.
```solidity
solidity function erc20Rescue(IERC20Upgradeable token, address destination, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) {
    require(amount <= token.balanceOf(destination), "Amount exceeds destination balance");
    token.safeTransfer(destination, amount);
}
```
