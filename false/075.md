# BLACKLISTER_ROLE can blacklist contract owner

## Summary
In the Stablecoin contract, addBlackList function adds an address to a mapping of blacklisted addresses. The function is designed to be called only by users with the BLACKLISTER_ROLE but there is no check that a user with this role to cant add the owner of the contract to the blacklist.

## Vulnerability Detail
The addBlackList function does not check whether the address being added to the blacklist is the owner of the contract. This means that a user with the BLACKLISTER_ROLE can add the owner of the contract to the blacklist, which could result in an owner cant access their funds.

## Impact
If a user with the BLACKLISTER_ROLE adds the owner of the contract to the blacklist, the contract owner will no longer be able to perform certain actions on the contract. This could include withdrawing funds or performing other critical operations which could result in a loss of funds or other damage to the contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
solidity function addBlackList(address holder) external onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) override {
    if (blacklisted(holder)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(holder);
    _blacklist[holder] = true;
    emit AddedBlacklist(holder);
    removeBlackFunds(holder);
}
```
