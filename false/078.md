# Owner can transfer all ERC20 reward token out using function erc20Rescue

## Summary
the function erc20Rescue is very privileged. It means to recover any token that is accidently sent to the contract, but there is no check that owner cannot send the amount to his address, i.e: there is no check on destination address. also there is no check on amount, malicious or compromised owner can send as much amount as he want to any address or his own address.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here, admin / owner can use this function to transfer all the reserved reward token, which result in fund loss of the pledge creator and the lose of reward for users.
